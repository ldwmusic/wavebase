## Who this README is for

**You (Lode)** — so you can maintain the site yourself for most edits,
without needing a developer or AI. Anything you can't find here is either
in the code as a comment or in a previous Claude conversation.

A future developer or contributor can also use this to get oriented in
~10 minutes.

---

## Quick start for the impatient

**To change text or add a spot:**
1. Open the file (see "Where things live" below) in any editor
2. Save
3. In Terminal:
   ```
   cd "/Users/ldw/AEPIC PLATFORM Dropbox/Lode De Waegenaere/CLAUDE/SURFSPOT WEBSITE"
   git add .
   git commit -m "short description"
   git push
   ```
4. Wait ~1 minute → it's live

**For non-text edits (CSS, JS):** also bump the `?v=NNN` numbers in every
HTML file before pushing. See "Cache busting" below.

**Don't like the terminal?** Use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
— click "Commit" and "Push origin" instead of typing commands. Or edit
files directly on github.com/ldwmusic/wavebase (pencil icon → edit → commit).

## Architecture in 60 seconds

- **Static site** — plain HTML, CSS, JS. No frameworks, no build step, no
  npm. Open any `.html` file in a browser and it works.
- **Deployed via Cloudflare Workers** from GitHub. Push to `main` →
  Cloudflare auto-rebuilds in about a minute.
- **All content lives in `data.js`** as a single JavaScript array.
- **No backend, no database** (yet). Phase 2 will change that.

That's it. Anyone who knows HTML/CSS/JS can maintain this.

## Where things live

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Discover page (home — hero, search, filters, results) |
| `spot.html` | Detail page used for every spot, stay, and center |
| `kaart.html` | Map tab (Leaflet) |

## Common edit recipes

### Change a tagline / description / intro

Search the text in `data.js`. Each entry has:
- `tagline` — short blurb on the card
- `verhaal` — story paragraphs on the detail page
- `samenvatting` — bullet summary
- `lagen` — labeled detail blocks
- `ideaalVoor` / `nietIdeaalAls` — who-it's-for / who-not bullets

Hit save, push. Done.

### Add a new spot

The fastest way: copy an existing spot entry in `data.js`, paste it
elsewhere in the array, then change:

- `id` — unique slug (lowercase, dashes, no spaces). Used in URLs.
- `type` — `"spot"`
- `country` — must match a country name in `WAVEBASE_DESTINATIONS`
- `name`, `town`, `tagline`
- `coords` — `[latitude, longitude]`. Easiest: right-click on Google Maps
  → copy coordinates → paste here
- `levels` — array, e.g. `["beginner","intermediate"]`
- `sports` — array, e.g. `["wave"]` or `["wind","kite","wing"]`
- `goodMonths` — array of month numbers when the spot is rideable
- `stats` — block with `periods`, `monthlyWindKn`, `monthlyAirC`, etc.
  (Easiest: copy a similar spot's stats block and edit values.)
- All the prose fields (`verhaal`, `samenvatting`, `lagen`, etc.)

### Add a new stay or center

Same as a spot but:
- `type` — `"stay"` or `"center"`
- Stays have a `verblijf` block with style/vibe/scores instead of `stats`
- Centers can have `linkedSpotId` — that links them to a spot so they
  inherit its wind/wave/temp data

### Booking links — the source-matching rule

**Where the data comes from = where the Book-now link goes.** If we
quote rates pulled from Booking.com, the "Book now" button on that
card MUST send the visitor to the Booking.com page (so the rate they
see matches what we showed). If we quote rates from the property's
own site (e.g. surf-camp packages), the link goes to the own site.

This is set per entry via the `bookingUrl` field:

```js
{ id: "flamingo-apartments",
  // data scraped from Booking → bookingUrl points to Booking
  bookingUrl: "https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/flamengo-apartments.html",
  prices: { source: "Booking.com checked 2026-05-19 ..." },
  // ...
}
```

When adding a new stay/center: pick the data source first, then set
the matching bookingUrl. Don't mix sources.

### Add a new country to the "soon" list

Edit `WAVEBASE_DESTINATIONS` at the bottom of `data.js`. Find the
continent, add to its `countries` array:

```js
{ name: "Sri Lanka", flag: "🇱🇰", status: "soon" }
```

When you actually have content for it later, change `"soon"` to `"live"`.

### Tweak colors

Top of `styles.css`, in `:root`:

```css
--sea: #3f6f7d;
--clay: #bd6242;
--sand: #e7dcc4;
...
```

Change a value, save, bump `?v=NNN`, push.

### Tweak the About page

`about.html` — straight HTML. Edit, push, done.

### Update fonts

Look in any HTML file for the Google Fonts `<link>` near the top.
Currently using Fraunces (serif headings) + DM Sans (body).

## Cache busting (important!)

When you change `styles.css`, `app.js`, `data.js`, or `account.js`, **bump
the `?v=NNN` numbers in every HTML file**, otherwise visitors will keep
seeing the old cached version.

Easiest way — in Terminal, from the project folder:

```bash
sed -i '' 's/v=133/v=134/g' *.html
```

(Replace `133` with whatever the current version is, and `134` with the
new one.)

Or in VS Code / TextEdit: find-and-replace across all `.html` files.

For pure HTML edits (e.g. changing About text), you don't need to bump —
HTML isn't cached.

---

## How deployment works

1. You `git push` to `origin/main` on GitHub
2. Cloudflare Workers picks up the change automatically
3. ~1 minute later, the site at `wavebase.lode-b162.workers.dev` is updated

No staging environment, no manual deploy step. Just push.

If you ever want to move off Cloudflare: this is plain static files. You
can host this anywhere — Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, your own server,
a USB stick (joking, mostly). Nothing about the code is locked to
Cloudflare.

---

## Local development

Most edits you can verify by just opening `index.html` in a browser
(double-click the file). But a few things need a local web server:
- The mini world map SVG (loaded via `fetch()`)
- Some `localStorage` features
- Cross-page navigation that uses absolute paths

To run a local server:

```bash
cd "/Users/ldw/AEPIC PLATFORM Dropbox/Lode De Waegenaere/CLAUDE/SURFSPOT WEBSITE"
python3 -m http.server 8765
```

Then open http://localhost:8765 in a browser. Stop the server with Ctrl-C.

## Map of `app.js`

It's a single ~3,500 line file. The big sections, in order:

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| Top of file | Constants: sport icons, country coords, ISO→continent table |
| `getStatsFor` / `userSelectedMonth` / etc. | Helpers used everywhere |
| `seasonForMonth` / `cardHTML` | Card rendering (used on Discover, Compare, etc.) |
| `buildDualBarChart` / `buildSingleMetricChart` / `monthlyChartHTML` | Monthly wind/temp/wave bar charts on spot pages |
| `wireChartTooltips` | Hover popovers on the bar charts |
| `renderStatsTicker` / `renderMiniWorldMap` / `renderPeakingCarousel` | Landing-page extras |
| `runSearch` | Discover-page search and filtering logic |
| `initIndex` | Discover page init |
| `initSpot` | Spot detail page init (the big one — most prose rendering happens here) |
| `initMap` | Map tab init |
| `renderAccount` / `renderCompare` | Account + Compare tab rendering |
| `initContinent` | Continent overview page |
| `initDestinations` / `openDestinationsMenu` | The "Where?" / Destinations dropdown |
| `initMobileTabbar` | Bottom nav on mobile |
| `wireHeaderSearch` | Persistent search bar in the header on non-Discover pages |
| End of file | Router — picks which `init...()` to call based on which page is loaded |

## What's NOT in this codebase (yet)

This is Phase 1 — a prototype. The following are deliberately out of scope:

- **Real database** — content lives in `data.js`
- **Real user accounts** — `account.js` only uses browser `localStorage`
- **Real reviews** — same as above, previews only
- **Admin panel** — edits happen via Git for now
- **Booking / affiliate links** — placeholder
- **Image uploads** — no spot photos yet (we use solid-color thumbs)
- **Multi-language** — English only

Each of these is a deliberate Phase 2 decision, not an oversight.

---

## Memory for Claude / future helpers

A few things that are easy to forget:

- **Spelling**: the Cretan village is **Palekastro**, not Palaikastro.
- **Review freshness**: experience-based info (crowds, locals, recent
  conditions) must come from reviews ≤4 years old. Static offerings
  (rentals, food) can come from anywhere.
- **Centers** (the surf-school kind), spelled American — not "centres".
- **Don't invent**: coords, booking links, claims about spots must be
  sourced or honestly flagged as inferred. Honesty is the brand.

## Roadmap (rough, not a promise)

- **Now (Phase 1)** — prototype, static, content-curated, getting feedback
- **Next** — content expansion (Portugal, more Crete, more Morocco)
- **Phase 2** — backend, real accounts, real reviews, admin panel
- **Phase 3** — multi-contributor (regional editors), business profiles,
  affiliate booking
